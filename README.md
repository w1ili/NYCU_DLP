# Deep Learning and Practice
Course projects for 535500 and 535501 of NYCU. (2023 NYCU Deep Learning and Practice)

#Lab 1: Backpropagation
Implement simple neural networks with forwarding pass and backpropagation using two hidden layers.

#Lab 2: EEG Classification
Implement simple EEG classification models which are EEGNet, DeepConvNet with BCI competition dataset.

#Lab3: Leukemia classification
Implement ResNet18/ResNet50/ResNet152 architecture to analyze accurate lymphoblastic leukemia (急性淋巴性白血病).

#Lab4: Conditional VAE for Video Prediction
Implement conditional video prediction in a VAE-based model.

#Lab5: Deep Q-Network and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
Implement two deep reinforcement algorithms by completing the following three tasks:
(1) Solve LunarLander-v2 using deep Q-network (DQN)
(2) Solve LunarLanderContinuous-v2 using deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)
(3) Solve BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4 using deep Q-network (DQN)
